As you are using RHEL 8, docker don't support RHEL 8 but you can still install it by bypassing a check

Step 1 : Configure the repo file for docker, Open a terminal and type

  cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
  gedit docker.repo
  
Editor will open in it type

[docker]
baseurl=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/
gpgcheck=0

--- 

Step 2: Do yum install docker-ce

yum install docker-ce

We have succesfully installed docker, now we insatll Docker compose in our system

---

Install Docker Compose by using these commands

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Do a check whether docker-compose is setup or not

docker-compose --version

Now we download the docker-compose.yml from the repo and place it in the /mycompose directory

---

mkdir /mycompose
cd /mycompos
ls
docker-compose.yml
While in the /mycompose directory type the following commads

docker-compose up

For the first time , it will take some time It will download the wordpress docker image, mysql docker image and create docker After the first setup, we can launch wordpress in one second by using the docker-compose up

---

To start docker-compose in background

docker-compose up -d

To stop docker-compose
